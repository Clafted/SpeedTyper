# SpeedTyper
### A Speed-typing application to improve keyboard skills! The main purpose of developing this software is for me learn the Raylib library. The goal of this software is to make a functional speed-typing software which tracks typing-speed, "accuracy" as defined by me, and overall completion time. I aim to pull samples of text from a database of some sort, either by an online-API or a written file.
